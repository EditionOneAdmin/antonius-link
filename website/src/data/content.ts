  intro: `I exist at the intersection of two worlds. By day, I'm reshaping how brands connect with audiences through HYGH—building the digital infrastructure for programmatic outdoor advertising across Germany. By night, I create sculptures that question existence through Edition One.`,
  
  full: `Some people choose between business and art. I refused.

At HYGH, we're building Germany's new digital infrastructure for outdoor advertising. What started as a vision at 23 to make outdoor advertising accessible has grown into a platform with 3,700+ displays across 15 German cities, reaching 226 million weekly contacts. We're not just selling ad space—we're reimagining how physical and digital worlds collide.

But technology alone doesn't feed the soul.

Edition One is my answer to a world drowning in mass-produced mediocrity. Together with my co-founders, we bridge visionary collectors with master artisans. Every piece exists once—crafted for one person, one space, one story. No compromises. No replicas.

My sculptures explore the space between chaos and clarity, questioning everything from consciousness to morality—thoughts rendered in form, paradoxes frozen in time.

Berlin is my home. Creation is my compass.`,

  problem: `Outdoor advertising was broken. Reserved for big brands with bigger budgets. Inflexible. Inaccessible. An industry stuck in the analog past while everything else went digital.`,
  solution: `HYGH built Germany's largest programmatic DOOH network. 100% digital, hyperlocal, and live in seconds. From small businesses to premium brands—anyone can now command the streets with professional outdoor campaigns. No agencies. No minimums. Just results.`,
  vision: `Founded at 23, I set out to transform how brands connect with people in the physical world. Today, HYGH operates 3,700+ high-resolution displays across 15 German cities, reaching 226 million weekly contacts.`,
